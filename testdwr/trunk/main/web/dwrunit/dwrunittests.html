		<h1>Tests for DWRUNIT</h1>
		<p>See below for test results. Error details are shown in the console on supporting browsers.</p>
		<p>Note: all test cases named "failing" are supposed to fail, to exercise the error reporting system. 
		    Some of them will show as passed because errors were discovered after completion, 
		    but these late errors will still manifest themselves in the browser's console or similar.</p>
