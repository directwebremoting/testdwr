TestDWR
=======
DWR client-side test harness

Project Status
--------------
This project is something of a work in progress. The final goal is to have an
ant based set of tests that will automatically run multiple servlet engines
and browsers and configurations, collating the results. Currently though, this
is a client-side webapp that runs its full-stack tests only on the server it is
installed to.

Building and running
--------------------
This source repository is intentionally missing the required dependency dwr.jar 
as we usually want to provide a local build of DWR when testing. You can set up 
a project dependency in Eclipse or use the Ant build to fetch it for you during 
compile time (you might have to specify the location where to look in Ant's
build.xml).

There are also various support for starting Jetty and Tomcat in Ant scripts and
Eclipse launch configurations.

Writing Tests
-------------
Step 1.\
Ensure that you can run the test suite as is.

Step 2 (optional).\
Create a Java function to be called by your Javascript test. If you will be
creating a set of tests then it might be worth adding a new class or even a new
package. The default location for tests is currently:

    main/java/org/directwebremoting/plain/Test.java

Step 3.\
Create some test function to exercise the client/server. The tests are located
in main/web/test*.js

If you need to create a new group of tests, create a new file called
main/web/testGroupName.js, and begin it by calling createTestGroup("GroupName");

You should then add functions to this file like this:

    window.testGroupNameTestName = function() {
      // test goes here
    };

The "window.testGroupNameTestName = function" format is needed because IE
doesn't pick-up functions as members of the window object if they are declared
using the more normal "function testGroupNameTestName() { ...}" syntax.

DwrTest defines all the usual assert*() functions which stop tests executing
and verify*() which just log the failure and carry on.
In addition you can use the useHtml(htmlString) function that inserts your HTML
into a space on the page reserved for your test.

It is common for DWR testing to require some asynchronous element, so we need
a way to associate delayed passes/failures with the test that caused pass/fail.
The utility createDelayed(function) can be used in this way. For example:

    window.testGroupTimeout = function() {
      var a = 6;
      window.setTimeout(createDelayed(function() {
        assertTrue(a, 5); // Delayed error will go against testGroupTimeout
      }), 1000);
    }

It could be used with a DWR proxied class 'Remote' as follows:

    window.testGroupRemote1 = function() {
      Remote.getData(createDelayed(function(data) {
        assertTrue(data, "expected");
      }), 1000);
    }

The utility createDelayedError() is useful when you wish to know if some error handler
is called. In the above case, if Remote.getData() causes an exception then
DwrUnit will not be able to associate the error with testGroupRemote1. You can
therefore do this:

    Remote.getData({
      callback: createDelayed(function(data) {
        assertTrue(data, "expected");
      }),
      exceptionHandler:createDelayedError()
    });

The utility createOptions() is a shortcut for the scenario above:

    Remote.getData(createOptions(function(data) {
      assertTrue(data, "expected");
    }));

The utility createVerifyCallback() should be used alongside functions with a return
type of org.directwebremoting.dwrunit.Verify. This enables the server to
perform a number of checks, and to pass the results back to the browser UI.
